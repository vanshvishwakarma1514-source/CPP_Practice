//clarifying the copy using scope resolution operator in front of the variable or method name
// in herarichical inheritance the two or more classes which are inheriting from a single base class should inherit a single copy in the class
// that inherit from the multiple classes
//abstraction is a mechanism using which complex implementation and data is hidden and only the required behaviour is exposed
//for ex- in a television the change of volume,brightness contrast etc is done either using a remote or the button pannel on th tv.
//in cpp abstraction is implemented using

//abstraction using abstract class
//asume that there is a class lnown as bacics calculator.it can only perform addition and substraction.
//due to sum reason multiplication and divivsion could not be implemented but there is a future scope of there implementation

// what is interface and abstraction
//interface- A class that has all the pure virtual functions and does not have implement functions these type of class is known as interface
